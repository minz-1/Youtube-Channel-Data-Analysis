Highlighting the top geopolitical risks for the year ahead, Bremmer explores the impact of Donald Trump’s return to power in the US, the breakdown of the US-China relationship, the consequences of a rogue Russia, the future of unchecked AI development and more, plus some bright spots amid these unprecedented challenges. (This interview, hosted by TED’s Helen Walters, was recorded on January 6, 2025.)\\n\\nThis interview is part of the series \"TED Explains the World with Ian Bremmer.\" Watch more: https://go.ted.com/tedexplainstheworldwithianbremmer\\n\\nRead Eurasia Group\\'s full Top Risks 2025 report here: https://www.eurasiagroup.net/issues/top-risks-2025\\n\\nCorrection: At 39:06, Bremmer misspoke when he stated that China would reach carbon neutrality before 2030. He meant to say that China is set to reach peak carbon emissions before 2030. The peak emissions target, not the net-zero target year (2060), is what is expected to be met ahead of schedule.\\n\\nIf you love watching TED Talks like this one, become a TED Member to support our mission of spreading ideas: https://ted.com/membership\\n\\nFollow TED! \\nX: https://twitter.com/TEDTalks\\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/ted\\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/TED\\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/ted-conferences\\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@tedtoks\\n\\nThe TED Talks channel features talks, performances and original series from the world\\'s leading thinkers and doers.

Listen to the full episode on the TED Audio Collective channel: https://youtu.be/42knY9id-6k?t=11m54s\\n\\nWhen Reese Witherspoon was in rehearsals for her lead role in the 2005 film Walk the Line, she wanted to quit — every day. But she went on to win the Oscar for her performance as June Carter Cash. Since then, she’s gone from playing iconic roles in films (Legally Blonde, Election, Water for Elephants) to\\xa0 producing and starring in her own TV shows and movies (Little Fires Everywhere, Big Little Lies, Wild). Reese talks to Adam about how she’s built confidence by facing her doubts head on and shares why acknowledging what she doesn’t know helped her found a company — which was recently acquired for $900 million — that finally puts women at the center of their stories.
